Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have become increasingly central to the effort, as they can undertake mitigation more economically efficiently than end users. This paper evaluates the role and performance of ISPs in mitigation. We employ three datasets of infected machines and map these to ISPs in 60 countries to measure the number of infections per subscriber. We find that ISPs are indeed control points and that they differ significantly in infection rates, even when operating under the same competitive pressures. We also find that national anti-botnet initiatives have had a positive, albeit limited, impact so far. The differences in performances can partially be explained by measures that reduce the cost of mitigation, partially by institutional factors, and partially by regulatory pressure. We discuss the implications of these lessons for cybersecurity policies.\",\"seats\":\"0\",\"goers\":\"65\",\"invite_only\":\"N\",\"venue\":\"&nbspHerbert\\/Pembroke\",\"id\":\"97b6e987a6643779cb76f7027816d3d1\",\"venue_id\":\"264634\",\"speakers\":\"Michel van Eeten\"},{\"event_key\":\"25\",\"active\":\"Y\",\"name\":\"Special Board Meeting\",\"event_start\":\"2015-06-08 12:30:00\",\"event_end\":\"2015-06-08 14:30:00\",\"event_type\":\"BOD\",\"description\":\"This is an official Board of Directors meeting for Board members only.&nbsp;\",\"seats\":\"50\",\"goers\":\"10\",\"invite_only\":\"N\",\"venue\":\"Ulster\",\"id\":\"9bf1f8d9822ef36305ce43f19a393c73\",\"venue_id\":\"297943\",\"moderators\":\"Jerry Upton (M3AAWG), Michael Adkins\"},{\"event_key\":\"lap05\",\"active\":\"Y\",\"name\":\"LAP\",\"event_start\":\"2015-06-12 08:00:00\",\"event_end\":\"2015-06-12 13:00:00\",\"event_type\":\"LAP\",\"description\":\"<em>Closed session for LAP members only; for details, contact Betsy Broder or the LAP Secretariat<\\/em>\",\"seats\":\"15\",\"goers\":\"0\",\"invite_only\":\"N\",\"venue\":\"Meeting Room 9\",\"company\":\"LAP\",\"id\":\"a353f9c2d794ccbe71f4dc781de12e3b\",\"venue_id\":\"321247\",\"moderators\":\"Betsy Broder (FTC)\"},{\"event_key\":\"11\",\"active\":\"Y\",\"name\":\"BCP discussion about NSP\\/ISP filtering of destination port 1900 SSDP and other ports\",\"event_start\":\"2015-06-11 15:30:00\",\"event_end\":\"2015-06-11 16:30:00\",\"event_type\":\"Collaboration, Technical\",\"description\":\"<p>SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) is a the discovery protocol of UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) intended for use in residential and SOHO LAN networks.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Many common HSI\\/Cable devices have allowed this protocol on the WAN level as well.&nbsp; In a perfect world, the modems would have this protocol disabled or filtered, however, reality is that the incredible volume of modem manufacturers, types, versions, and ability for an ISP to remotely manage these devices makes disabling SSDP on the Internet cost, time, and resource prohibitive.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So, in order to reduce the impact of reflective DDoS attacks due to this vulnerability, NSPs and ISPs should consider filtering or limiting destination port 1900, and possibly limiting source port 1900 based on packet size.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Much like M3AAWG supports port 25 filtering, supporting port 1900 filtering or limited can be an effective anti-abuse strategy for NSPs and ISPs. &nbsp;This session will discuss the creation of a possible BCP to support this strategy.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;Also to be discussed is how to take this discussion of port 1900 and extend it to the other identified potential UDP DDoS amplifiers.<\\/p>\",\"seats\":\"0\",\"goers\":\"16\",\"invite_only\":\"N\",\"venue\":\"&nbspHerbert\\/Pembroke\",\"company\":\"Collaboration Committee,Technical Committee\",\"id\":\"a71476354e1afc0bb65c59c665aa8e58\",\"venue_id\":\"264634\",\"staff\":\"Sara Roper\"},{\"event_key\":\"46\",\"active\":\"Y\",\"name\":\"Guide Prep Meeting\",\"event_start\":\"2015-06-08 15:00:00\",\"event_end\":\"2015-06-08 16:00:00\",\"event_type\":\"training\",\"description\":\"<p>A brief prep meeting for the Guides before the New Attendee Orientation starts.

The immediate goal of these attacks is to compromisetarget systems by executing a snippet of malicious code in the context of theexploited application. Technical tactics used to achieve this can beclassified as either code injection &mdash; wherein malicious instructions aredirectly injected into the vulnerable program &mdash; or code reuse, where bits ofexisting program code are pieced together to form malicious logic. In thistalk, we present a new code reuse strategy that bypasses existing and up-and-coming mitigations, as well as methods for detecting attacks by identifyingthe presence of code injection or reuse payloads.<br \\/>More specifically, our new code reuse strategy, dubbed just-in-timeexploitation, exposes the limitations of contemporary fine-grained addressspace layout randomization as well as all other widely deployed mitigations.In doing so, we motivate the need for detection of such exploits rather thansolely relying on prevention. To address that need, we also discuss two newtechniques for detecting attacks by identifying the presence of a payload.Code reuse payloads are identified by first taking a memory snapshot of thetarget application, then statically profiling the memory for chains of codepointers that reuse code to implement malicious logic. Code injectionpayloads, on the other hand, are identified with runtime heuristics thatleverage hardware virtualization for efficient sandboxed execution of allbuffers in memory.

This collaboration aims to enable law enforcement to engage with hosting providers and determine which factors influence internet abuse in the Dutch hosting provider market, based on robust metrics. As such, this project intertwines large data sets on Internet abuse with robust metrics and the criminological concepts of problem-oriented policing and positive criminology.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>We present an approach to develop reputation metrics for the security of hosting providers. The existing security rankings are based on limited sources of abuse data. More importantly, they do not adequately take into account the size of hosting providers. Large hosting providers experience higher number of abuse incidents than smaller ones, because they have more customers. It does not necessary mean that they perform worse in terms of preventing or mitigating abuse events. To overcome these limitations, we have developed metrics that combine heterogeneous blacklists and normalize in different ways for the size of the hosting provider.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Next, we will present how several law enforcement agencies will use the proposed metrics to engage the hosting provider community. Law enforcement aims to discover which characteristics - if any - distinguish hosting providers with relatively large numbers of security incidents from the ones with relatively few security incidents.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Furthermore, law enforcement aims to stimulate the self-cleaning capability of the hosting provider market.

The Heartbleed vulnerability of April 2014, which allowedthe remote disclosure of secret keys from HTTPS web servers, is anindicative example of such a catastrophic event. In this talk, I willpresent our recent work on PixelVault, a system for keeping cryptographickeys and carrying out cryptographic operations exclusively on the GPU, whichallows it to protect secret keys from leakage even in the event of fullsystem compromise. We have implemented a PixelVault-enabled version of theOpenSSL library that allows the protection of existing applications withminimal modifications. Based on the results of our evaluation, PixelVaultnot only provides secure key storage using commodity hardware, but alsosignificantly speeds up the processing throughput of cryptographicoperations for server applications.\",\"seats\":\"0\",\"goers\":\"8\",\"invite_only\":\"N\",\"venue\":\"&nbspLansdowne\",\"company\":\"Academic Committee\",\"id\":\"dc59cce4f1751a10afe0b010296c6725\",\"venue_id\":\"264637\",\"speakers\":\"Michalis Polychronakis\",\"moderators\":\"Manos Antonakakis\"},{\"event_key\":\"break-b1\",\"active\":\"Y\",\"name\":\"Breakfast & New Attendees Meet-Up\",\"event_start\":\"2015-06-09 07:00:00\",\"event_end\":\"2015-06-09 09:30:00\",\"event_type\":\"Break\",\"description\":\"<p>Breakfast is included in the hotel sleeping room rate, and is served to all hotel guests in Sussex Restaurant beginning at 6:00 AM. <br \\/>7:00 - 8:30 For new attendees you can get a head start on the feel of the conference, find out how the committees work, or just get some basic housekeeping questions answered while eating breakfast with a few M3AAWG committee chairs and Board members at one of the clearly labeled &ldquo;New Attendees&rdquo; tables.<\\/p>\",\"seats\":\"0\",\"goers\":\"36\",\"invite_only\":\"N\",\"venue\":\"~Sussex Restaurant\",\"id\":\"dec017ef482bd5f2a5bb46efc3b543f4\",\"venue_id\":\"297949\"},{\"event_key\":\"3\",\"active\":\"Y\",\"name\":\"Designing a Whitehat Platform from the Ground Up\",\"event_start\":\"2015-06-10 14:00:00\",\"event_end\":\"2015-06-10 15:00:00\",\"event_type\":\"Senders\",\"description\":\"Opinionated product decisions become guardrails for your customers.
