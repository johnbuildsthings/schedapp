Examples include expired bank domains, software update do- mains, web sites in support of browser plugin up- dates, the domains users for CIDR allocations, and nameservers used by universities. Attackers are increasingly using expired domains to confuse network defenders, or avoid network filtration rules based on domain black (or white) lists.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Detecting changes in domain ownership can be done deterministically by analyzing WHOIS information, but this is costly and difficult at scale. Net- work policies in domain registrars, non-standardize text-free format of the WHOIS records, and geopolitical considerations (i.e., domain names registered under the national top level domain of Kazakhstan, will receive a WHOIS record only if the requesting IP is delegated to the national ISP) make the retrieval of WHOIS information a daunting task.\\t&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>As residual trust of the domain names has the potential to confuse even the most sophisticated reputation system, and effectively used in a variety of Internet attacks (from spamming and phishing to targeted attacks), there is a need for efficiently track- ing it.

Network operators have been delegated the daunting task ofsecuring the cyber infrastructure of their organizations. &nbsp;On a daily basis, defenders must contemplate the levels of insecurity in their networks, to determine what risks require attention and resources. &nbsp;Unfortunately, objectively defining cyber risk remainsdifficult, given the lack of an objective and repeatable metric. Network administrators often guess what parts of their network remain insecure, and spend their resources based on estimates.<br \\/><br \\/>Failure to create such an objective yardstick for the insecurity of modern networks can result in two fallacies regarding operationalnetwork security. First, network operators will not be able to compare (in an repeatable manner) the security levels between their networks. Such &nbsp;omparisons are invaluable as they enable the evaluation of the risk within a sector. &nbsp;Second, the lack of metrics make it impossible for defenders to create reasonable security strategies that can (1) objectively yield network environments with less risk, and (2) define clear ways to identify and mitigate new risks in their networks. &nbsp;Defenders, in absence of such a yardstick, may not have the ability to improve the levels of network security, for example, even after a post-mortem analysis of a security event.
